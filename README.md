 ##Caveats

 Although I have included the built site (/dist) The site will only render locally on FF due to get request of data from a json file. Run "grunt serve" from /app folder to create a local server to view full site.

# Responsive Web Page

## Overview

In the zip file there are 3 designs of the same page, Desktop, Tablet and Mobile version.

## Instructions

 - Build page with HTML/CSS
 - Page must be responsive. (Tip: Start with mobile)
 - You can use a CSS framework eg. Bootstrap (getbootstrap.com)
 - jQuery isn't mandatory, but if you can and want to incorporate, you can. (Extra credit)
 - You will notice there are a few icons in the design, if you're using font icons (eg. fontello.com), you can replace those in the design with any icon, doesn't have to match design.
 - If you don't use jquery for on clicks, then just make it hover states to show and hide certain elements with css.
 - You can use build processes like Gulp or Grunt with SASS or LESS (Extra credit)
